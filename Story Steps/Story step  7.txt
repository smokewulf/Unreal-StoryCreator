Step 7:https://github.com/allenai/objaverse-xl.git
 **3D Model **:  start creating the 3D models. This AI would take instructions from the Text to Video AI and generate 3D models as needed. For example, if the Text to Video AI determines that a scene needs a certain type of character or object
The output should be sent to NeRF

Step 7 (3D Model). The goal here is to leverage the instructions and blueprint generated in Step 6 by SORA to produce the required 3D assets—characters, props, sets, and any other elements necessary for the scenes. By the end of this step, you will have a collection of optimized, game-ready 3D assets aligned with the storyboard and screenplay.

Step 7: 3D Model
Objectives:

Take the structured video plan (shot-by-shot, scene-by-scene) from SORA and identify all the 3D assets needed.
Utilize AI-driven 3D modeling tools (e.g., objaverse-xl) to generate or retrieve high-quality 3D models.
Ensure that the resulting models follow the specifications set by the storyboard and SORA’s blueprint—matching styles, scales, and environmental details.
Store all finalized models in the Unreal Engine project folder, ready for integration in the upcoming NeRF (Step 8) and HDRI (Step 9) steps.
Key Tools & Technologies:

AI 3D Model Generation:
objaverse-xl: Leverage this AI solution to generate or suggest 3D models from textual prompts.
Data from Previous Steps:
The structured plan from Step 6 (SORA), which details what characters, props, and environments each scene requires.
Character FBX models from Step 3 (for main characters), ensuring no duplication of what’s already done.
Genre, setting, and style cues from Steps 2 & 4 to maintain visual consistency.
Blender or Other 3D Software Integrations:
For refinement, retopology, and ensuring that models follow UE best practices.
Detailed Steps
Analyze Requirements from SORA’s Blueprint:

Extract a list of required assets for each scene:
Characters: Already generated in Step 3, but confirm if any secondary characters or variations are needed.
Props: Furniture, tools, vehicles, foliage, weapons—anything indicated in the blueprint.
Sets/Environments: Indoor rooms, outdoor landscapes, architectural elements.
Create a master “Asset Checklist” per scene, ensuring you have a definitive, itemized list of what must be modeled or sourced.
Set Modeling Criteria:

Define artistic style and fidelity based on initial story and genre decisions (Step 2) and consistent with character models:
Realistic, stylized, photo-realistic, cinematic, etc.
Determine polygon budgets and performance constraints suitable for Unreal Engine.
Establish naming conventions, scale units (e.g., metric), and coordinate systems compatible with UE standards.
AI Model Generation & Retrieval (objaverse-xl Integration):

For each required asset not already available:
Use objaverse-xl with a textual prompt derived from the SORA blueprint and story details. For instance:
“Generate a low-poly medieval wooden table, 1 meter by 2 meters, dark oak finish, slightly worn edges.”
If a close match exists in a large model repository (objaverse includes a vast dataset), retrieve and adapt it rather than generating from scratch.
Iterate if necessary:
If the initial generated model doesn’t match style or scale requirements, refine the prompt and regenerate.
Allow user intervention if significant adjustments are needed (e.g., “The chair looks too modern—make it more rustic”).
Quality Assurance & Optimization:

Once a model is generated, import it into a 3D editing tool (e.g., Blender) to:
Check geometry: Ensure clean topology, no unnecessary polygons.
Create or adjust UV maps for proper texture application.
Generate LOD (Level of Detail) variants for performance in Unreal Engine.
Apply consistent material and texture naming conventions.
Run automated checks or use Computer Vision feedback loops (planned in Step 10) to ensure quality standards are met.
Texture & Material Integration:

If the AI only provides a base mesh:
Generate or apply textures and materials.
If textures are provided, ensure they follow PBR (Physically Based Rendering) standards for compatibility with Unreal Engine.
Adjust lighting or roughness maps to match the scene’s mood (if indicated in SORA’s blueprint or storyboard).
Rigging for Non-Character Assets (If Needed):

Most props and environment meshes may be static.
If any assets require basic animation (e.g., doors, drawers), include simple skeletons or pivot points so that they can be animated later in Unreal.
For unique characters or creatures not covered in Step 3, perform a similar rigging process (IK/FK) to ensure they’re animation-ready.
Validation and User Review:

Provide a visual preview panel in the web UI:
Let the user rotate and inspect the 3D models.
Confirm the match with the intended description. If changes are necessary, refine and regenerate.
Exporting & Saving to Unreal Engine Project Folder:

Export final, optimized models in FBX format (or other UE-compatible formats).
Place them in the user’s specified Unreal Engine project directory structure, e.g.:
Content/Art/Props/
Content/Art/Environments/
Content/Art/Characters/ (if new characters were created)
Update the database with references to each model’s file path and metadata.
Forwarding to NeRF (Step 8):

Once all 3D models for the relevant scenes are prepared, send the scene data (including references to the newly created models) to the NeRF step.
The NeRF step will use these assets to construct accurate 3D scenes from multi-view images and then forward to HDRI lighting and beyond.
Benefits of the Revised Process
High-Fidelity, Pipeline-Ready Assets: By following a defined style and adhering to performance constraints, the models are immediately ready for Unreal Engine integration.
Efficiency through AI & Reuse: Leveraging objaverse-xl and existing repositories saves time and ensures models are quickly generated or sourced.
Quality Assurance Before Integration: Early checks and optimization prevent issues downstream, reducing the need for later rework.
Smooth Transition to Next Steps: Organized assets and metadata make it easy for subsequent steps (NeRF, HDRI, etc.) to access and use the models without confusion.
By following this improved step-by-step strategy for Step 7, the 3D modeling process becomes a streamlined pipeline of AI-driven asset generation, user verification, optimization, and readiness for the next stages of the automated production workflow.
