Step 5:
**Storyboard**: Create Storyboard app using 'https://github.com/ramenhost/storyboarding?tab=readme-ov-file' as a tool
Create a storyboard with detailed shot list for production. Seperate into acts and scenes. (Should be able to change or update the shot per user input)
The output should saved. The user should be able to send storyboard, Screenplay, and Story  output to Text to Video one scene at a time.



Step 5 (Storyboard). The goal is to translate the screenplay (with its acts, scenes, dialogues, and timings) into a visually oriented plan—a storyboard. The storyboard will detail camera angles, shot compositions, character placements, and transitions. This allows the user to visualize the production before moving into text-to-video and subsequent automated steps.

Step 5: Storyboard
Objectives:

Convert each scene from the screenplay into a series of storyboard panels.
Represent camera angles, framing, character positions, and major actions visually.
Allow the user to adjust and refine shots, angles, and transitions.
Organize the storyboard by acts and scenes, and clearly associate timing notes and dialogues for reference.
Prepare a final storyboard that can be sent scene-by-scene to the next step (Text-to-Video / SORA).
Key Tools & Technologies:

Storyboard Creation Tool:
Utilize the tool from storyboarding repository if it provides APIs or integration methods, or use a custom React-based interface with canvas or SVG elements.
Integration with Previous Steps:
Import screenplay data (scenes, dialogues, timestamps) from Step 4.
Reference character appearances and details from Steps 2 and 3 to ensure visual consistency.
Detailed Steps
Importing Screenplay Data:

Load the structured screenplay data produced in Step 4.
Parse each act and scene, and present them as a collapsible list or timeline on the left side of the screen.
Show key attributes:
Scene number (e.g., Act 1, Scene 2)
Scene description
Timestamp markers (e.g., Scene starts at 00:02:15)
Dialogue lines with character emotions
Initial Storyboard Generation:

For each scene, generate an initial storyboard suggestion:
Break the scene into key moments (beats) based on dialogues, actions, or camera moves noted in the screenplay.
For each beat, create a placeholder panel:
Show character placeholders (e.g., rough sketches or icons) at approximate positions.
Suggest a camera angle (wide shot, close-up, medium shot, POV) based on screenplay action notes.
Include basic text overlays: scene description, dialogue snippet, or action cue.
These initial suggestions come from heuristics or simple AI logic that interprets the screenplay’s instructions (e.g., “At 00:02:15, character C draws a sword” might suggest a medium shot focusing on that action).
User Interaction & Customization:

Provide a panel-based editor:
Panels Display: Each scene is represented by a sequence of panels (frames).
Drag & Drop: Allow the user to rearrange panels within a scene.
Drawing Tools (Optional): Users can add annotations, sketch character placements, or indicate camera movements directly on the panel using a simple drawing interface.
Camera Presets: Dropdowns or icons for common camera setups (close-up, over-the-shoulder, wide shot, aerial shot).
Character Placement & Direction: Add UI elements that let users drag character icons in a 2D layout to indicate their positions and directions.
The user can also:
Add or remove panels to better represent the flow of the scene.
Change camera angles: For example, switch a wide shot to a close-up if the action or emotion warrants it.
Insert textual notes: “Character A should move slowly from left to right in this shot” or “Increase lighting intensity here.”
Timing & Scene Transitions:

For each panel, associate a time range or a timestamp relative to the scene.
If the screenplay includes transitions (cuts, fades, wipes), indicate them between panels:
For example, a “CUT TO:” line in the screenplay translates to a transition between the last panel of one scene and the first panel of the next.
Provide a timeline view at the bottom of the screen:
Scenes and panels placed along a timeline.
Users can adjust panel durations or reorder shots to match the timing specified in the screenplay.
Character References & Asset Integration:

For convenience, display character reference images generated in Step 3 next to the storyboard panels.
This helps the user recall what each character looks like and ensures that the storyboard visually matches the character designs.
Optionally, let the user attach additional reference images or color palettes to each panel.
Iterative Feedback Loop:

Users can quickly switch between scenes, refine panels, and update notes.
If a scene feels off, the user can return to the screenplay step (Step 4) to adjust the narrative or timings, then return to the storyboard to reflect changes.
Provide version control or a history of changes so users can revert to earlier storyboard layouts.
Saving the Storyboard:

Once satisfied with the scene’s panels, the user clicks “Save.”
The application stores the storyboard data (panels, notes, camera angles, transitions) in the database.
Export options:
JSON or a similar structured format: for downstream AI tools.
PDF or image sequence: for offline reference or collaboration with a team.
Forwarding to the Next Step:

The user can choose “Send to Text-to-Video (SORA)” for a particular scene.
When doing so:
The tool packages the scene’s storyboard data, along with the screenplay and story information, into a structured format.
This data is then passed to the next stage (Step 6) where SORA will use it to guide the initial video planning.
The user can do this scene-by-scene to maintain granular control over the workflow.
Benefits of the Revised Process
Visual Clarity & Pre-Visualization: The storyboard gives a clear visual plan of the final product before heavy 3D modeling and animation.
User Control & Flexibility: Users can refine camera angles, shot compositions, and transitions until they are satisfied, ensuring the final production follows their vision.
Consistent Workflow: The storyboard references the screenplay and character designs, maintaining a consistent narrative flow and look.
Structured Output for Downstream Steps: By organizing the storyboard data, the next AI steps (Text-to-Video, 3D modeling, NeRF, etc.) have a clear blueprint to follow.
By following this improved step-by-step strategy for Step 5, the storyboard creation process becomes a dynamic, iterative, and user-friendly experience. It sets the stage for a smooth transition into the automated steps of generating video plans and ultimately producing high-quality animations in Unreal Engine.
